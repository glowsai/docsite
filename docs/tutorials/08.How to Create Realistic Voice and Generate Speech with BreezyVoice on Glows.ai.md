# How to Create Realistic Voice and Generate Speech with BreezyVoice on Glows.ai

This tutorial will guide you step-by-step to run the voice synthesis system **BreezyVoice** on Glows.ai, leveraging the **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4090** GPU to quickly generate personalized voice audio files.

**[BreezyVoice](https://github.com/mtkresearch/BreezyVoice)** is an open-source system focused on Chinese Text-to-Speech (TTS) synthesis, featuring:

- Voice cloning with only **5 seconds** of voice sample
- Natural and fluent speech output, close to a real human voice
- Based on the [CosyVoice](https://github.com/FunAudioLLM/CosyVoice) extension, part of the Breeze2 series

Next, we will use Glows.ai’s cloud GPU resources to run **BreezyVoice**, create your voice, and generate speech files.

## Step 1: Create a New Instance

Create an instance on Glows.ai by following this [tutorial](https://docs.glows.ai/docs/Create%20New). Make sure to select the official **BreezyVoice WebUI** image.

On the `Create New` page, select **Inference GPU -- 4090**, then choose the **BreezyVoice WebUI** image. This image contains all required environments and will launch the BreezyVoice WebUI service on port 8080.

![image-20250527142118492](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/01.png)

**Data Drive** is Glows.ai’s cloud storage service. Users can upload data, models, or code to Data Drive first. When creating an instance, clicking the **Mount** button links the Data Drive to the instance, making it easy to access files inside the instance.

Once everything is ready, click the `Complete Checkout` button at the bottom right to create the instance.

![image-20250527142206510](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/02.png)

It takes about 30–60 seconds to start the **BreezyVoice WebUI** instance. Once the instance is up, you can see its status and info on the `My Instances` page. Relevant ports include:

- **SSH Port 22** : SSH connection
- **HTTP Port 8888** : for JupyterLab
- **HTTP Port 8080** : for BreezyVoice WebUI service

![image-20250527142608982](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/03.png)

## Step 2: Use BreezyVoice WebUI

On the `My Instances` page, click the `Open` button under **HTTP Port 8080** to launch the **BreezyVoice WebUI** service.

![image-20250527142840557](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/04.png)

In the **BreezyVoice WebUI**, you can upload a recorded audio file or click `Record` to record a voice sample (recommended 20–30 seconds).

Next, enter the corresponding transcript in the text box.

![image-20250527143100877](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/06.png)

Then, input the text you want the AI to synthesize in the "Enter text to synthesize" box, and click `Synthesize Audio`. The generation takes about 7 seconds (depending on the size of the voice file and the length of the synthesized speech).

After synthesis completes, click the `Play` button to listen, or click the `Download` button at the top right to save the audio file to **Data Drive**.

![image-20250527143541680](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/07.png)

## Step 3: Call BreezyVoice API

Besides using it via browser, **BreezyVoice** can also be used as an API service.

In `My Instances`, click `Open` on **HTTP Port 8888** to launch JupyterLab. Then open the `Terminal` under the `Other` category to get a command-line interface.

![image-20250527145829523](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/08.png)

Open the file `BreezyVoice-api.py` in the left sidebar, change the port from 8080 to 8081, and save the file with `Ctrl + S` to avoid conflict with the BreezyVoice WebUI service port.

![image-20250527150120234](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/09.png)

If you want to use custom voice samples, open `api.py` and modify the audio file paths and corresponding transcript text in the code to your own audio and text.

![image-20250527153430931](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/11.png)

In the terminal, run the following commands sequentially to start the API service:

```bash
cd /BreezyVoice/
python api.py
```

![image-20250527153307923](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/10.png)

The service listens on port 8081. In the **My Instances** page, click `New Port Forwarding` to add a port forwarding rule. Fill in the following information and click `Create`:

- Port number: 8081
- Protocol type: HTTPS

![image-20250527153652631](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/12.png)

It takes about 15 seconds to complete the port setup. If the page does not refresh automatically, please refresh manually. Then you can click the `Copy` button next to HTTP Port 8081 to copy the API link.

```bash
https://tw-02.access.glows.ai:23197?token=jrF2uJF3yj
# The token part is a parameter tag and can be omitted
```

![image-20250527153921579](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/13.png)

After installing the OpenAI package locally, you can test the API with the following code:

```python
# If OpenAI is not installed, install it first via: pip install openai
import openai

client = openai.Client(base_url="https://tw-02.access.glows.ai:23197", api_key="sk-template")

response = client.audio.speech.create(
    model="tts-1",
    voice="alloy",
    input="放學我們一起去打籃球怎麼樣，今天天氣不錯",
)

speech_file_path = "./test_speech.wav"
with open(speech_file_path, "wb") as audio_file:
    audio_file.write(response.content)
```

Alternatively, use the following curl command to call the API directly:

```bash
curl -X POST "https://tw-02.access.glows.ai:23197/v1/audio/speech" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-template" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model": "tts-1",
    "voice": "alloy",
    "input": "放學我們一起去打籃球怎麼樣，今天天氣不錯"
  }' --output test_speech.wav
```

After execution, a file named `test_speech.wav` will be generated locally, which is the synthesized speech audio.

## Advanced Usage: **Auto Deploy**

The previous method requires manual creation and release of instances, which can be cumbersome if usage is infrequent.

Therefore, Glows.ai offers an **Auto Deploy** service. After configuration, you get a fixed link. When this link receives a request, Glows.ai automatically creates an instance and processes the request. If no new requests are received within 5 minutes, the instance will be automatically released.

Follow the steps below for actual operation.

### Configure **Auto Deploy**

Go to the `Auto Deploy` page and click the `New Deploy` button at the top right to add a deployment configuration.

![image-20250527162345042](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/14.png)

![image-20250527162731979](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/15.png)

![image-20250527162828692](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/16.png)

### View Configuration Info

![image-20250527162928849](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/17.png)

### Call Auto Deploy Link

Calling the API is the same as before, just replace the API link with the **Auto Deploy** link.

```bash
curl -X POST "https://tw-01.sgw.glows.ai:xxxxxx/v1/audio/speech" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk-template" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data '{
    "model": "tts-1",
    "voice": "alloy",
    "input": "放學我們一起去打籃球怎麼樣，今天天氣不錯"
  }' --output test_speech.wav
```

![image-20250527163237581](../tutorials-images/08.BreezyVoice/18.png)

After the request finishes, if no new API calls are made within 5 minutes, the system will automatically release the instance resources.

On the Auto Deploy page, you can see the total cost and instance status for each deployment. The statuses mean:

- **Standby**: Configuration is ready, no running instance currently.
- **Idle**: Request received, instance is being created; or instance is being released automatically.
- **Running**: Instance successfully created and processing requests. After completion, it waits for new requests; if none for 5 minutes, the instance is released automatically.
